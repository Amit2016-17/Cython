# Cython

Cython is an optimising static compiler for both Python and the extended Cython. It makes the syntax writing C extension as easy as Python itself. 

Cython combines the advantage of Python and C to let you interact efficiently with large data sets. As Cython drops down the code to the machine level, it speeds up the execution of Python code.

The compiled extension of Cython involves three files:
Main file
The function to be compiled inÂ .pyx file
A setup.py contains the instructions to make the extension module
